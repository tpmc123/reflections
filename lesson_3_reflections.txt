- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

if u are working with others on the project or u want to share the repository with others. 


- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

in case others are udpating the remote repository. 


- Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

a fork is a "clone" of someone else's repository on GitHub. the fork resides in the forker's GitHub acct.
a clone is a replica of a repository. it is downloaded onto a local machine.
a branch is a version of some local repository. there can be multiple branches at once, each different from the other.
